Считается, что он расширяет возможности человека и увеличивает выносливость, что было так важно для тех, кто тяжело работал в полях. Таким образом, он в основном использовался для поддержки человека во время тяжелого физического труда. В связи с этим мужчины употребляли намного больше кратома, чем женщины.
